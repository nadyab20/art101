			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> It was challanging breaking down the tasks of our game. Connect 4 is a pretty simple game to play, but it was harder than we though to break it up into certain steps and sub steps. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> The main problem that arose was using javacript for the first time and inputting our pseudocode. But after some trial and error we ended up victorious!   </p>
			</div>
